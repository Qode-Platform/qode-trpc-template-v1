# Built by .github/workflows/deploy.yml (context ., file Dockerfile) and pushed
# to Artifact Registry. Adapted from the fleet's nextjs stack pack.
#
# Deviations from the pack, and why:
#   - `npm install` when no lockfile is committed; the pack assumes `npm ci`.
#   - next.config sets `output: "standalone"`, which the pack's runtime stage
#     requires (.next/standalone) but the stock config does not enable.
#
# BASE_PATH is NOT baked in: it is per-agent and only known at run time, so the
# image serves at the host root under k8s and the agent's /direct/<id>:<port>
# run supplies its own prefix.
