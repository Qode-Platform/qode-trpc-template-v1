# tRPC template

Provisioned from [`Qode-Platform/fleet-template-v1`](https://github.com/Qode-Platform/fleet-template-v1) — the fleet
lifecycle contract (`bin/`, `fleet.conf`, deploy workflows) with a
tRPC starter laid on top.

## Origin

    npx create-t3-app@latest trpc --CI --trpc --appRouter --tailwind --noInstall

Generated 2026-09-21 on Node v22.12.0 / Python 3.12.3. **Dependencies were
never installed and this has never been built or run.** Boot it once before
trusting it.

## Fleet lifecycle

`fleet.conf` drives every script in `bin/`:

| step | command |
|---|---|
| install | `npm install` |
| build | `npm run build` |
| start | `npx next start -H 0.0.0.0 -p $PORT` |

    ./bin/run       # install, build, start in the foreground
    ./bin/start     # start from existing build artifacts
    ./bin/restart   # rebuild and restart
    ./bin/stop      # stop whatever holds the port

Listens on `$PORT` (default `3000`); health check hits `/`.

## Serving

The fleet injects `PORT` and `DATABASE_URL`. The app is served at the root
(`/`) of its own hostname, so routes, assets and API calls use plain
root-relative paths.

## What differs from stock output

- create-t3-app is the scaffold tRPC's own docs point to, so this is Next.js + tRPC + Tailwind, not tRPC alone.
- t3 validates env at build time; set SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1 if you add required vars before wiring them.

# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.
